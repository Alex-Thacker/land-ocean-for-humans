# Land Ocean for Humans

Welcome to Land Ocean for Humans. This app was designed to help people gain access to a local swimming pool. The app has two main features, sharing your pool and finding a pool.  If the user has a pool, they're able to share it with the public if they like and if they don't have a pool, they're able to find one that other users have shared. The app also features a weather forecast so you know if its a good day to swim or not. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
